## Presentation
IRC is a project by 42 School, whose goal is to develop a protocol-compliant IRC server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously using a real IRC client.
It focuses on network programming, socket and TCP communication management, as well as non-blocking I/O processing and concurrency.

## Usage
```
make
# compiles the executable 'FT_IRC'

./FT_IRC <port> <pass>
# starts the IRC server listening on the specified port
```
